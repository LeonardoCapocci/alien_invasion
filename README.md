# alien_invasion
Play as a spaceship that shoots down aliens as they move across and down the screen.

With all the files downloaded in a folder and with python and pygame installed on your system you can run alien_invasion.py.

You can control the ship with left/right keys or A/D and you can shoot bullets with space bar. You have 3 lives to play with and the levels get harder to the point of impossible.
